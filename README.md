# ESP32-Cam Graphical User Interface using PyQt5

## About :

This interface program allows users to perform object and face detection using an ESP32-Cam or webcam. The application captures frames from the selected source, processes them using deep learning models to detect objects and/or faces, and displays the frames with the detection results in real-time. The program also includes additional features such as brightness adjustment, blurring, and labeling of the detected objects.

## Features :
- Visual/Special Effects
- Object Detection
- Face Detection
- Database Integration (unimplemented yet)

## Design :
I created the interface design using the Qt5 designer. There were multiple design prototypes, but this was the final and current design.
